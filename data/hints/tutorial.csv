"Research Elements","[center][img]res://assets/tutorial_pictures/research_element.png[/img][/center]

"Tower Stash","[center][img]res://assets/tutorial_pictures/tower_stash.png[/img][/center]

"Items","[center][img]res://assets/tutorial_pictures/item_drop.png[/img][/center]
 
An item dropped! Creeps sometimes drop items. You can see the items you have in the [color=GOLD]Item Stash[/color].

"
"Tower levels","[center][img]res://assets/tutorial_pictures/tower_level.png[/img][/center]
 
One of your towers has leveled up! You can see the current tower level in the top left corner of the tower menu.
 
Towers become more powerful as they level up. You can read more about level bonuses in [color=GOLD]Hints[/color].
"
"Portal damage","A creep has reached the [color=GOLD]portal[/color]! When creeps reach the [color=GOLD]portal[/color] they deal damage to it. When portal lives reach [color=GOLD]0%[/color] it's game over!
 
Note that [color=GOLD]Challenge[/color] waves don't deal damage to the [color=GOLD]portal[/color]."
"Wave finish","[center][img]res://assets/tutorial_pictures/wave_finish.png[/img][/center]
 
You have finished a wave! Finishing a wave grants multiple rewards:
 
You get new random towers. Check your [color=GOLD]Tower stash[/color]!
 
You get a gold bonus called [color=GOLD]Income[/color].
 
You get new [color=GOLD]Knowledge tomes[/color], which are used for researching elements."
"Challenge wave","The next wave will be a [color=GOLD]Challenge[/color] wave. These waves are harder than normal and it's very likely that you won't be able to kill the creep. That's ok because [color=GOLD]Challenge[/color] waves deal no portal damage. Use these waves to test the power of your towers."
"Upgrading towers","[center][img]res://assets/tutorial_pictures/upgrade.png[/img][/center]
 
At this point, you might be able to [color=GOLD]upgrade[/color] one of your towers. Try selecting different towers and checking if you can [color=GOLD]upgrade[/color] them.
 
[color=GOLD]Upgrading[/color] changes a tower into a more powerful version with improved stats and abilities.
 
It's a good idea to [color=GOLD]upgrade[/color] towers with highest levels first.
"
"Transforming towers","[center][img]res://assets/tutorial_pictures/transform.png[/img][/center]
 
Another way build powerful defenses is by [color=GOLD]transforming[/color] towers.
 
To [color=GOLD]transform[/color] a tower, start building a tower like you normally would but move the mouse to an existing tower. The tower cursor will turn blue to indicate that you can [color=GOLD]transform[/color] it. Click to complete the process.
 
[color=GOLD]Transforming[/color] replaces a tower with a new tower, keeps the level of the previous tower and also refunds the cost of the previous tower!
 
If you built a tower long time ago and it's not as powerful anymore, [color=GOLD]transforming[/color] it into a more powerful tower is a good strategy.
