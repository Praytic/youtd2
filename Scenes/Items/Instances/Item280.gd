extends Item


# NOTE: original script implemented miss effect via "attack"
# event. Not sure how that's supposed to work because
# setting event.damage to 0 in attack event should have no
# effect. At least it has no effect in the godot engine, so
# I changed to this script to use "damage" event. Maybe it
# does work in JASS engine that way, need to test this item
# in original game and change how attack event is handled in
# godot engine if needed.
